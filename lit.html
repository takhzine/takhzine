        <h6>⁽¹⁾ Lead Years</h6>
        <h4>
        The Years of Lead (Arabic: سنوات الرصاص, romanized: Sanawāt ar-Raṣāṣ) (Tamazight: ⵢⵉⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙⵏ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵢⴰⵣⴰⵡⵜ, romanized: Yissgwasen n Tayarzawt) 
        was a period of the rule of King Hassan II of Morocco, from roughly the 1960s through the 1980s, marked by state violence and repression 
        against political dissidents and democracy activists.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽²⁾ Hassan II</h6>
        <h4>
        Hassan II was king from 1961 until his death in 1999. His reign was marked by political unrest and a heavy-handed government response to criticism 
        and opposition. Political repression increased dramatically upon Hassan's ascent to the throne of the country in 1961, and this repressive political 
        climate would last for nearly three decades.
        Due to strong popular mobilization from the Moroccan democracy and human rights activists and pressure from the general Moroccan population, as well 
        as pressure from the wider international community, Morocco experienced a slow but notable improvement in its political climate and human rights situation. 
        The pace of reform accelerated with Hassan II's death and the accession of his son Mohammed VI to the throne in 1999.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽³⁾ MRE</h6>
        <h4>
        Moroccans living abroad, who have set up committees to fight repression in Morocco in the 1970s in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, 
        with correspondence in other countries in Europe and the rest of the world. Their role was to inform about the repression, to materially 
        support the victims, to ensure their defense by sending legal and medical missions and to popularize the fight against these repressions.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁴⁾ Ahd Jadid (New Era)</h6>
        <h4>
        Morocco’s years of lead ended with the release of remaining political prisoners in 1991. There followed a period of optimism, with the King’s 
        allowing the formation of civil society groups, more political freedoms, and the formation of the country’s first opposition government in 1998. 
        Another era of optimism began after Hassan II’s death and the ascendency to the throne of his son Mohammed VI in 1999. The sense of optimism was 
        palpable as opposition leaders and former political prisoners spoke freely of a new era in Morocco and praised the young king for being “quite 
        different from his father.”
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁵⁾ Moroccan Observatory of Prisons (OMP)</h6>
        <h4>
        An independent non-governmental organization created in 1999 by human rights activists to protect and promote the rights of detainees.
        It acts as an observatory of penitentiary conditions in Morocco, as a unit of legal assistant to the detainees and of treatment of the grievances, 
        as a center of research, information, training and advocacy for a more humane prison and to improve the legislative framework in accordance with 
        international standards in this area.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁶⁾ Oukacha Penitentiary</h6>
        <h4>
        Oukacha has been at the center of controversy for its overcrowding, physical and sexual violence, trafficking, etc.
        The prison, designed for 5800 prisoners, actually accommodates 7856 prisoners. This makes it 1.2m2 per person, 
        instead of the minimum international standard which is 9m2. Worse, the bulk of the troops are made up of detainees 
        in pre-trial detention at 39% (still decreasing; in 2008, they represented 46%). 
        Waiting times for judgment can range from 1 to 5 years in many cases so many prisoners sleep on the floor, under beds and on shelves.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁷⁾ Hchouma</h6>
        <h4>
        Literally translated, hchouma means shame, although it holds far more weight than does its English equivalent. 
        It is an element of everyday Moroccan life that is entrenched in society but never discussed or defined; as such, 
        it has become one word that encompasses myriad meanings and beliefs. According to CultureShock! Morocco, it is the 
        response to behavior that “contravenes social norms, breaks Islamic precepts, and abrogates personal obligations 
        inside or outside of the family” (Hargraves 2006: 53); it is a tool of socialization and control that teaches people 
        not to engage in such kind of behavior. Some see hchouma as a force that preserves one’s public image. Others believe 
        it is no more than a question of respect for yourself and others. Soumaya Naamane-Guessous, the feminist author of 
        <i>Au-delà de toute pudeur</i>, sums up the multifaceted nature of hchouma quite simply: “<i>La hchouma de l’un 
        n’est-elle pas la hchouma de l’autre</i>” (Guessous 1992: 6). Hchouma means something different depending on your 
        gender, upbringing and age.

                <h2>
                Since the early 1980s, a few prisoners have published in foreign countries their poetry, fiction and personal accounts about prison and torture.
                The majority, however, published prison testimonies in Morocco after Hassan II’s⁽²⁾ death. The political transition, far from being simply a top-down 
                process, also resulted from the struggle of human rights activists, former prisoners and their families. Beginning in the 1970s, Moroccans residing
                abroad (MRE)⁽³⁾ created associations to denounce state repression and abuses. In Morocco in the 1970s and the 1980s, activists founded human rights 
                associations.

                Fatema Mernissi, writes about the face of the prison guard reading the letter burning with passion that the wife of one of the political prisoners 
                had just given him: 
                "<i>Lover of my soul, gemini of my psyche, my poet and noble husband Mohamed Ibn al Arbi al-Assafi. My love, I feel the insistent urgency of 
                expressing to you in the columns of this letter my stormy desire and my irresistible tenderness to see you again, even if it is only through 
                the prison bars.</i>" (Touria Sekkat "Letters from prison", Dar an-Nachr al-Maghribia. Casablanca, 1988.)
                Such letters, written during the Years of Lead are an introduction to the underground universe of the unspeakable, that of the wives, 
                mothers and sisters of political prisoners, as it has the merit of capturing fragments of flickering memories of the female crowds swirling 
                around the distressing prison doors. It is these women, called illiterate, who have dug, by dint of harassing police and torturers, the furrows 
                of democracy in Morocco as in the rest of the countries, Arab countries. They were the actors of a profound social change both at the level of 
                the family and at the level of society in general. Their role, however, remained hidden. Tribute is paid here to these women builders of 
                democratic Morocco, to their courage and their stubbornness because they admirably symbolize the emergence of new forms of women's participation 
                in civic action.

                Saida Menebhi (1952 in Marrakesh – 11 December 1977 in Casablanca) was a Moroccan poet, high school teacher, and activist with the Marxist 
                revolutionary movement Ila al-Amam. In 1975, she, together with five other members of the movement, was sentenced for seven years of imprisonment 
                for anti-state activity. On November 8, 1977, inside the jail in Casablanca, she participated in a collective hunger strike, and died on the 35th 
                day of the strike at Avicenne Hospital.

                Her poetry, collected and published first in 1978, and later again in 2000, is considered a prime example of Moroccan revolutionary and feminist 
                literature. She wrote in French. Translations of a selection of her poems to English were published for the first time in 2021 by See Red Press.

                Fatna El Bouih (born 1956) is a Moroccan human rights activist and writer. As a student during the Years of Lead, she became an activist with 
                the leftist youth protest movement, calling for democracy as a member of the National Union of High School Students. She was arrested in 1974 
                as a leader of a high school student strike, but she was released after a night in jail. She became a leader of Harakat 23 Mars. In 1977, she 
                was arrested again during the mass arrests of members of the "23 Mars" Marxist group. This time, she spent five years in prison, during which 
                she was tortured at Derb Moulay Cherif. However, thanks to a solidarity movement among the inmates, she was able to gain better detention 
                conditions, political prisoner status, and the opportunity to continue her studies. She earned a bachelor's and master's degree while in prison.
                El Bouih has written several books and other publications on the Years of Lead, the fate of political prisoners, and violence against women. 
                She is the first woman, after the series of books written by men, to provide her own testimony on the human crushing machine that is political 
                detention and the tyranny of the years of lead.

                Political violence against women was a taboo topic in Morocco and has remained a sensitive issue among 
                former political prisoners. When El Bouih became involved in the feminist movement in the early 1990s, she realised that even feminists 
                had difficulty addressing political violence: “<i>I worked in reception centres for battered women. Violence is always assumed to be conjugal 
                and domestic, but political, state violence is a silent violence, nobody talks about it.</i>” To break the silence surrounding political 
                violence against women, since 1994 El Bouih has been sharing her personal experience in newspaper articles and television interviews.
