        <h6>⁽¹⁾ Maghrebi immigrant workers</h6>
        <h4>
        France has a long history of immigration, which started long before other European countries. It began towards the end of the 19th century, 
        after a period of French population decline and [a resulting] need to increase France’s labour force due to industrialisation, or what is called 
        in French, ‘les grands travaux’. Many migrants came from neighbouring countries like Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and Poland. 
        However, they also came from the Maghreb because of the colonial history of France in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽²⁾ CSRP</h6>
        <h4>
        Comités de Soutien à la Révolution Palestinienne (committees in support of the Palestinian revolution or CSRP), 
        also known as the ‘Comités Palestine’ (Committees for Palestine). Created in reaction to Black September (1970) 
        and dissolved in 1972, the Comités Palestine were mostly composed of Arab workers and students. They were part 
        of the first organisations to stand in solidarity with the Palestine people in France, and the creators of the 
        Mouvement des travailleurs arabes (Movement of Arab Workers or MTA) in June 1972.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽³⁾ Arab Nationalism</h6>
        <h4>
        Within the Arab nationalist movement are three main ideas: that of the Arab nation; Arab nationalism; and pan-Arab unity. 
        The 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine led to the foundation of the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party, which asserts that the 
        Arab nation is the group of people who speak Arabic, inhabit the Arab world, and who feel they belong to the same nation. 
        Arab nationalism is the "sum total" of the characteristics and qualities exclusive to the Arab nation, whereas pan-Arab 
        unity is the modern idea that stipulates that the separate Arab countries must unify to form a single state under one political system.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁴⁾ Fatah</h6>
        <h4>
        Fatah (Arabic: فتح, romanized: Fatḥ), formerly the Palestinian National Liberation Movement 
        (حركة التحرير الوطني الفلسطيني, Ḥarakat al-Taḥrīr al-Waṭanī l-Filasṭīnī), is a Palestinian 
        nationalist and social democratic political party. It is the largest faction of the confederated 
        multi-party Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the second-largest party in the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC).
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁵⁾ Yasser Arafat</h6>
        <h4>
        Yasser Arafat (August 1929 – 11 November 2004) was a Palestinian political leader. Ideologically an Arab nationalist and a socialist, 
        Arafat was a founding member of the Fatah political party, which he led from 1959 until 2004. Fatah, which adopted social democracy 
        and pan-Arabism as its pillars, played a critical role in the Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation. Arafat saw Zionism as 
        an aggressive, imperialist and fascist movement with its ideology, methods and organization. For liberating Palestinian lands from 
        Israeli occupation, armed struggle is a must, he believed. Apart from Israel, the Palestinian resistance he led sometimes was compelled 
        to fight Arab countries, including Jordan, where he left for Lebanon in 1971.
        Against this background, he said: “<i>Today, I have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive branch 
            fall from my hand. I repeat do not let the olive branch fall from my hand,</i>” in his speech in 1975 at the UN General Assembly.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁶⁾ Khalil Wazir</h6>
        <h4>
        Khalil Ibrahim al-Wazir (October 1935 – 16 April 1988) 
        was a Palestinian leader and co-founder of the nationalist party Fatah. As a top aide of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
        Chairman Yasser Arafat, al-Wazir had considerable influence in Fatah's military activities, eventually becoming the commander of 
        Fatah's armed wing al-Assifa. In October 1959, he edited a periodical called “Call of Life-Our Palestine,” published in Beirut, 
        which came to reflect the views of Fatah. Khalil Wazir was one of the principal architects of the first popular intifada, 
        which broke out in December 1987. He took part in leading it and in supporting it right until the time of his martyrdom.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁷⁾ LIP</h6>
        <h4>
        Five years after May '68, during the summer of 1973, the employees of the Lip watch factory in Besançon led one of the most 
        significant social struggles of the 20th century. “Lip Affair” designates the course and actions of a strike which took place 
        in the Lip watch factory in Besançon. Started in the early 1970s, the struggle lasted until mid-1976 and mobilized tens of 
        thousands of people across France and throughout Europe, notably during the great Lip march of September 29, 1973 which 
        brings together more than 100,000 demonstrators in a ghost town. The Lip affair marks a radical change in the union tone and 
        the rise of “spontaneous” movements widely reported in the media. It gives rise to abundant journalistic and cinematographic 
        production presenting the company manager and the shareholders as “rotten”.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁸⁾ Sonacotra</h6>
        <h4>
        Sonacotra, presently Adoma, is a mixed economy company, a subsidiary of the CDC Habitat group (Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations) 
        which was created in 1956 by the French State to accommodate migrant workers. Sonacotral (National Society for the Construction of 
        Housing for Algerian Workers) was created in 1956 to resolve the problem of unsanitary housing for workers from Algeria 
        (around 150,000 Algerians living in slums, in particular around Paris, or in other precarious housing). 
        To cope with the housing shortage, the company built its first foyer in 1959 in Argenteuil.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h6>⁽⁹⁾ CDVDTI</h6>
        <h4>
        The Committee for the Defense of the Lives and Rights of Immigrant Workers (CDVDTI, Comité de défense de 
        la vie et des droits des travailleurs immigrés) was created jointly by members of the Movement of Arab 
        Workers (MTA, Mouvement des Travailleurs Arabes) and their allies Geneviève Clancy and Philippe Tancelin, 
        members of Al Assifa, the MTA's theater troupe.

                Influenced by Marxism and Arab nationalism⁽³⁾, the MTA (Arab Workers Movement) wanted to build an Arab political organization in France 
                independent of “French” organizations and the authorities of Arab countries. The MTA was particularly committed to the fight against racism 
                and for the rights of immigrant workers but was also one of the first organizations in France in support of the Palestinian people.

                for equal rights in the postcolonial metropole.

                    out the ranks of the unemployed in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, and to work in inhumane conditions and in this way increase the profits

                    In addition to the publication, Radio Assifa was, in 1975, the first sound and activist experience of North African immigration, 
                    a true precursor to free immigration radio in the form of cassettes.
                    The idea of ​​producing this type of cassette comes from previous experiences: in the 1970s, Radio LIP⁽⁷⁾ broadcasted cassettes via 
                    loudspeaker in demonstrations, and Radio Assifa broadcasted cassettes around the struggles of immigrant workers, notably on the 
                    channels of Renault factories or in Sonacotra⁽⁸⁾ hostels on rent strike.

                    <h2>
                    The cassette was rediscovered with the message: 
                    "Radio Assifa produced by the Arab workers of the Assifa Theater Troupe and all Arab musicians and journalists grouped together 
                    against racism. Radio Assifa gives the right to speech and expression to Arab workers. Radio Assifa is the radio for all Arabs."

                    Al Assifa does not consider itself a theater troupe: “Al Assifa has never been a “theater troupe”, but a cultural action collective made 
                    up of French people and immigrants and whose vocation remains to promote a current of expression and action with immigrants and French people,
                    against slavery, against racism.”
